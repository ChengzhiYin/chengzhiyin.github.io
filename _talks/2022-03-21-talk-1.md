At the panel entitled "Evolvement, Change, Consistency in China’s Diplomatic Policy Since the Reform and Opening Era," I discussed China's strategies toward the U.S.-South Korea alliance in the 2010s and the policy implications for East Asia. The panel was part of the 2022 V-BRYGE Conference, co-organized by Vanguard Think Tank and US-China Better Relations Coalition. It aims to encourage university students and academically advanced high school students worldwide to conduct research on China and international relations.
