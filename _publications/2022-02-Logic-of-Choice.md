## Abstract

Employing archives from China, the United States, and Russia, this article explores the question of how China chose its binding strategy to stop North Korea from tilting toward the Soviet Union in the late 1960s. I argue that China's binding strategy was shaped by its assessment of North Korea's reliability as an ally and the severity of the Soviet threat. When China perceived North Korea as unreliable but the Soviet threat as manageable, it adopted a strategy of conditional support. When both North Korea's reliability and the Soviet threat were high concerns, China shifted to unconditional support to ensure North Korea remained within its sphere of influence.
