I have taught "Introduction to International Politics" at Boston College. It is an introductory level course for political science majors. This course examines the principle sources of the behavior of countries in international politics, including the nature of the international system and the decision-making process within states. This course is strongly recommended for students who plan to take upper level international politics courses.
