I teach undergraduate and graduate courses on international politics and Chinese foreign policy, and strive to help students at all levels apply international relations theories to critically engage with the world. <!--- To consistently improve my pedagogy and inclusiveness, I completed the [Apprenticeship in College Teaching Program](https://www.bc.edu/content/bc-web/academics/sites/center-for-teaching-excellence/programs-events/graduate-student-programs/Apprenticeship-In-College-Teaching.html#tab-summer_2022) at Boston College. --->
