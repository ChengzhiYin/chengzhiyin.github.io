Welcome to my website!

I am an Assistant Professor of Political Science at the [Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs](https://www.maxwell.syr.edu/academics/political-science-department) at Syracuse University.

I use both qualitative and quantitative methods to study international security and Chinese foreign policy. My research comprises two streams: The first studies the determinants, conduct, and consequences of China's security policy, and the second explores alliance dynamics and great powers' influence attempts through coercion and inducement.

My research has been published in *Security Studies*, *International Negotiation*, *Journal of American-East Asian Relations*, and *Issues & Studies*.

I earned my Ph.D. in Political Science from Boston College and my B.A. from Tsinghua University. Before joining Syracuse, I was a postdoctoral fellow in Columbia University's [China and the World Program](https://cwp.sipa.columbia.edu/people/chengzhi-yin) and a [Hans J. Morgenthau Fellow](https://ndisc.nd.edu/people/opportunities/the-notre-dame-international-security-center-hans-j-morgenthau-fellows) at the Notre Dame International Security Center (2020–2021).
