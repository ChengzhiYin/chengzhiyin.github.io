Welcome to my website!

I am an Assistant Professor of Political Science at [the Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs](https://www.maxwell.syr.edu/academics/political-science-department) at Syracuse University.

I use both qualitative and quantitative methods to study international security and Chineseforeign policy. My research comprises two streams: The first studies the determinants, conduct,and consequences of China’s security policy, and the second explores alliance dynamics andgreat power’s influence attempts through coercion and inducement. My book project sits at theintersection of these two streams, analyzing how great powers seek to divide adversarial alliances while defending its own. The core empirical chapters focus on China, and the conclusion tests my theory’s applicability using U.S. and Soviet/Russian cases.

My published work has appeared in [*Security Studies*](https://doi.org/10.1080/09636412.2022.2097891), [*International Negotiation*](https://doi.org/10.1163/15718069-bja10122), [*Journal of American-East Asian Relations*](https://doi.org/10.1163/18765610-02603002), and [*Issues & Studies*](https://doi.org/10.7033/ISE.201409_50(3).0003).

I hold a Ph.D. in Political Science from Boston College and B.A. from Tsinghua University. Before joining Syracuse University, I was a postdoctoral fellow in the [China and the World Program](https://cwp.sipa.columbia.edu/people/chengzhi-yin) at Columbia University. In 2020-2021, I was a [Hans J. Morgenthau Fellow](https://ndisc.nd.edu/people/opportunities/the-notre-dame-international-security-center-hans-j-morgenthau-fellows) at the [Notre Dame International Security Center](https://ndisc.nd.edu/). I also worked with the Fletcher School's [Rising Power Alliances project](https://sites.tufts.edu/cierp/rising-power-alliances-project/) at Tufts University.
